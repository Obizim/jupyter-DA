## Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib

This is a practice repo to learn about pandas library, numpy as well as using Matplotlib for visualizations.

I'm using a datset about the box office movies for the marvel cinematic universe. 

### Data Cleaning
1. Removed the dollar sign and commas in the figures
2. Changed the trnasformed figures datatype to numeric. This aids for the calculations
3. Renamed the columns(removing the \n sign)
